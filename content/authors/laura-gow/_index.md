I work in the philosophy of mind with a particular focus on perception. My recent research explores the role cognitive experience plays in phenomena often thought to be perceptual â€“ absence experience, for instance. I am now extending this investigation to examine how cognitive experience influences other domains, such as action and decision-making.
