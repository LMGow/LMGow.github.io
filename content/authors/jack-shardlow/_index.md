I am a researcher primarily working between the philosophy of mind and psychology, though I have overlapping interests in various sub-disciples. My main interest derives from combining empirically informed philosophy of mind with phenomenologically-led research; to date, much of this has focused upon how we experience and think about distinctively temporal phenomena.
