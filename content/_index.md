        The Role of Cognitive Experience in Decision and Action” is a three-year research project jointly funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation, and the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR). We aim to explore belief-discordant behaviour and offer a new explanation which emphasises the role played by how things seem to us.
