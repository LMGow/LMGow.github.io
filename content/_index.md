        The Role of Cognitive Experience in Decision and Action
      image:
        filename: logo-large.png
      text: |
        We are all guilty of sometimes failing to act in line with what we believe. Our aim is to provide a new explanation of belief-discordant behaviour which emphasizes the role played by how things seem to us.

        The Role of Cognitive Experience in Decision and Action is a three-year research project jointly funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation, and the Luxembourg National Research Fund.
